# Loaders Modernized

A Space Aged, compact loader the size of a single tile.  These loaders should be relatively UPS friendly
and do not use LUA script to move items.  They also do not use hidden inserters to move inventory.  However, they
do use power.  So keep those power poles handy!

## Features

- Works in Factorio 2.0 and supports Space Age.
- Control by circuit supported.
- Works with cargo wagons.
- Loaders snap to belts and away from non-belts.
- Stack items on to the belts based on belt stacking technology level.
- Split Lanes!!!
- AAI Loader graphics can be used as long as AAI Loader mod is installed.
- Stacked loaders can be used without Space Age!  This requires the use of the [Stack Inserters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/stack-inserters) mod.
- ~~Able to migrate Miniloaders.~~ Miniloader migration functionality moved to its own mod - [Miniloader migration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/miniloader-migration).
