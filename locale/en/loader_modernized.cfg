mdrn-enable-chute=Enable chute loader
mdrn-enable-stack-loader=Enable stack loader entity

[mod-setting-description]
mdrn-use-electricity=When set to true the loaders will require electricity to operate.
mdrn-double-recipe=Double the recipe cost and produce 2 loaders at a time so that undergrounds are consumed in pairs.
mdrn-enable-chute=Enable a recipe to create a very slow loader-style chute.
mdrn-enable-stack-loader=Enable a recipe to create a separate stack-loader entity at turbo-loader speed. Intended to be used with stacking disabled for all other loaders.
mdrn-enable-stacking=Enable belt stacking loaders.\n\n[color=blue]Separate stack loader[/color]: Separate loader to stack items.  Recipe will require stack inserters\n\n[color=blue]Turbo Loader+ only[/color]: Only tiers turbo and above will be able to stack items on to belts.\n[color=blue]All[/color]: All loaders can stack.  Single recipe per tier that does not require stack inserters, but is more expensive than none.  Belt stacking level must be provided by another mod (eg. Space Age!, Stack Inserters, other)\n[color=blue]None[/color]: Loaders will not stack.  Loader recipes are less expensive.
mdrn-cheap-stacking=When belt stacking is set to 'All', use the cheaper non-stacking recipes for loaders.
mdrn-use-aai-graphics=AAI Loaders has been detected.\nUse the graphics set from AAI Loaders for Loaders Modernized.\n\nThis is intended to be used with AAI Loaders 'Operation mode' set to 'Graphics-only'
mdrn-use-aai-recipes=AAI Industry has been detected.\nUse AAI Industry based recipes for Loaders Modernized.
mdrn-keep-5d-loaders=Keep the loaders provided by 5Dim's Transport mod in addition to Loaders Modernized.
mdrn-keep-turbo-loader=Keep turbo loaders available in the game. They are the same speed as Mk 4 loaders, but more expensive.
mdrn-unlock-technology=Choose to unlock loaders with separate technology, or along with other logistics at the same tier.
